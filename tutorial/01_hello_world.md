# The Morepath Tutorial with Superpowers!

## Chapter 1: Hello, World!

- Python and virtualenv?
- MG separates app and routes for some reason, doing this in morepath is slightly harder since it involves creating a setup.py which can be intimidating to newcomers. If we don't include installing python this first chapter would be super simple, maybe we should get that out of the way

- First Hello, World! directly from the docs
    + `python microblog/app.py`
- Separate into app, model and paths/views, why doesn't it work?
- Project structure, setup.py + run.py
    + console scripts?
    + `python microblog/run.py`
