# Part 3: Forms

In this part we'll add a simple login form to our microblog. The form will not authenticate the user but we will handle validation, errors and success for a simple case.

We use the popular [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/) library to build and validate our form and start styling our microblog a bit with the help of [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

To run the example:

1. `cd 03_forms`
2. `pip install -e .`
3. `python -m microblog.run`
